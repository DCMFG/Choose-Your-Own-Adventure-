	<h1>The Game Must Continue!</h1>
	<p>You did it! You've reached the end of the maze! It turns out Mr. Maze has was being sincere. Although you and he have had your differences while you were protecting (insert location here) he did enjoy mentally sparring with you. The secret you uncovered is that he was inspired by your past encounters and you believing he could use his mind for more than his elaborate ego-driven schemes. He wants to partner up with you... and if that's not on the table, would at least like to compete with you albeit in a less antagonistic way! What an amaz(e)ing development!! <p>
	
	<p> Congrats!! <p>
